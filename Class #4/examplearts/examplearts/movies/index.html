    <h1>Movies and its sub catagories</h1>
    <p>
        Movie is short for "moving picture," which was pretty exciting in the late 1800s. 
        You can rave about your favorite movie — whether it's "Citizen Kane" or "The Lion King" — 
        and you can also talk about "the movies," or films in general and the industry that makes them.
